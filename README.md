# Attack Maps and Log Visualization
In this project, I create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and install the open-source support ticket system, osTicket v1.15.8. This includes setting up IIS, PHP, MySQL, and configuring required dependencies to get osTicket running locally.

## Technologies Utilized
