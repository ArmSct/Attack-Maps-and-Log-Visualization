# Attack Maps and Log Visualization
In this project I use all the logs being created within the environment (some frome students, some from bad actors on the internet) to create world map visualization workbooks for various scenarios based on originating IP address just to give a visualization of whatâ€™s happening in the network.

All relevant logs from network devices, servers, and applications will be systematically collected and forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM).
